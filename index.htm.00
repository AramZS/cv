    <p class="first">Aram Zucker-Scharff is out to find a better narrative for the world. Over the past few years he has built himself an understanding of new media, marketing and advertising from the ground up. By starting in the midst of the radical alteration of how we consume media, it has become clear that new media requires new methods of understanding. </p>

	<p>Aram firmly believes that you have to comprehend the spectrum of knowledge that supports professional techniques in order to create effective and unique innovation. This means knowing the basic elements of how to tell a brand's story as well as understanding the code and hardware behind the digital systems we use every day. </p>

	<p>His approach is to understand where technology and narrative meet. Then we can work together to find the best way to apply that knowledge to strengthen the brand.</p>
